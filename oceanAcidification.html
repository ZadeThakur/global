			<p>Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans,
			 caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.[2] Seawater
			  is slightly basic (meaning pH > 7), and ocean acidification involves a shift
				towards pH-neutral conditions rather than a transition to acidic conditions
				 (pH < 7).[3] An estimated 30â€“40% of the carbon dioxide from human activity
				  released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes.
					 To achieve chemical equilibrium, some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid.
					 Some of the resulting carbonic acid molecules dissociate into a bicarbonate ion and a
					 hydrogen ion, thus increasing ocean acidity (H+ ion concentration). Between 1751 and
					  1996, surface ocean pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14,
						 representing an increase of almost 30% in H+ ion concentration in the world's
						 oceans. Earth System Models project that, within the last decade, ocean acidity
						  exceeded historical analogues[9] and, in combination with other ocean biogeochemical
							 changes, could undermine the functioning of marine ecosystems and disrupt the provision
							  of many goods and services associated with the ocean beginning as early as 2100.</p>
